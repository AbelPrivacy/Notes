Named after Niels Hedrick Abel, the Norwegian mathematician credited with inventing Group Theory

Create collection of packages with permissively licensed versions and proprietary versions:
1. Over-the-Air mobile apps to ensure up-to-date bytecode with option for offline version
2. VPN with configurable levels of privacy
3. Onion Encryption Package that features options for multiple block cipher encryptions (storage space intensive) or encryption of block cipher key with multiple rounds of asymmetric encryption to save on disk space. How to work in Multifactor Authentication? How does this compare to consensus implementations?
4. Platform-independent messaging app 

Proprietary Projects
1. Find larger primes for larger key sizes
2. Look into ways to handle arbitrarily large int variables using C for cryptographic protocols using arbitrarily large key sizes
3. Study Asymmetric Cryptography including Elliptic Curve Cryptography (is that book still in Madrid?)
4. Study block cipher cryptography.

Products and Services:
1. Consulting
2. Licensing Dynamic Libraries: protect IP with obfuscation, license agreements, encryption that requires internet connectivity, and intermittent license checking
3. Licensing static Libraries: require additional third-party auditing, distribute smaller binaries appropriate for static linking, â€¦
